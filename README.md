# JavaScript-Slot Machine

My first project using only JavaScript and Node.js.

The project consists in a Slot Machine that has 4 different symbols, each one with a value.
The user can prompt his amount of money and play with the game until he's done or run out of money.
The player can choose if he wants to bet in 1, 2 or 3 lines at a time.
If he gets 3 matching symbols in a line, he's a winner in that line.

Go on and try it!
